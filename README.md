# GudTimes
For my Software Development course at Queen's University. My team is making a calendar desktop application that will display a user's .ics calendar. Features include adding events to a calendar, removing events from a calendar, scheduling events between multiple users (time finding algorithm to avoid calendar conflict), and a notification system. By the end of the 12-week project, we were able to get all of the listed functionality complete and demo it for the class.

<h1>Motivation</h1>
For our Software Develpoment course at Queen's University (CMPE/CISC 320), we were tasked with making a program in 12 weeks. We decided to base our project on a common problem students have - being unable to schedule events or meetings due to not knowing others' availability. This is why we created GÃ¼dTimes.
