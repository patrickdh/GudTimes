For my Software Development course at Queen's University. My team is making a calendar desktop application that will display a user's .ics calendar. Features include adding events to a calendar, removing events from a calendar, scheduling events between multiple users (time finding algorithm to avoid calendar conflict), and a notification system. By the end of the 12-week project, we were able to get all of the listed functionality complete and demo it for the class.
